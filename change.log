----

## v2.0.1.0 / SpaceK33z@817a7f38680a045f8c688fd357b241b3f811d36c

- **Removed manager requirement (Options | Managers)**
    - unintentional feature; would force the user to have at least one valid manager
- Hid debugging information
  - see issue #21 

## v3.0.0.0 / unreleased

- Made numerous changes as a BETA for v4 (explained below)

- Created /change.log
    - used in order to keep up with version changes more easily
- **Removed strict equality for item searches: /utils.js**
    - equality tests for the IDs (IMDb, TVDb, & TMDb) were strict and unpredictable (Number vs. String) and was therefore "dumbed" down to reduce errors
- Fixed The TV DB error: no air date when series' air date is the current month and year (e.g. Aug 2018 for "Insatiable")
    - the `o.first_airdate` property was undefined and would cause a Type error when the airdate was the current month and year
- Changed the color of the version number on the Option's page (for better readability)
    - was grey and blended in; changed to white
- **Changed "Save As..." to ignore unidentified movies (e.g. no ID, but still able to save the file)**
    - movies saved via direct links (i.e. Flenix) would fail without an ID--the user probably doesn't care and just wants the movie
- Removed extra Flenix buttons (got too complicated); but left the skeleton for extra buttons for future usage
    - the last button was ugly and discolored; plus Flenix added more buttons, so I just left the top button
- Changed Trakt's button location
- **Added support for Watcher 3 (Movie NZB Manager)**
    - See issue #24
- **Added support for Trakt's "Watch Now" links**
  - see issue #25
- Added `/img/_16.png` and `/img/_48.png` as monochrome, logo icons
- Added new button location images
- **Added a TMDb API key section**
  - Not sure if this'll be used
