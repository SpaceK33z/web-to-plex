# Web to Plex

This browser extension adds a Plex button on movie pages like IMDb, letting you immediately open the movie or TV show on Plex Web if it is available.

Optionally you can configure CouchPotato or Radarr in the options. After that, you can immediately add a movie to CouchPotato/Radarr, with one click, right from your favorite movie page.
