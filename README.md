# Movieo to Plex

This Chrome extension adds a Plex button on Movieo and IMDb movie pages, letting you immediately open the movie on Plex Web if it is available.

Optionally you can configure CouchPotato in the options. After that, you can immediately add a movie to CouchPotato, with one click, from Movieo or IMDb.

## Usage

Before using the extension, you need to configure it in the Options page (go to `chrome://extensions` and click on Options next to the extension).

It is somewhat difficult to configure, but everything should be explained well. Please don't hesitate to [submit an issue](https://github.com/SpaceK33z/movieo-to-plex/issues/new) if the configuration is unclear.
